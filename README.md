As a seasoned Tech Lead with 6 years of software development experience, I have honed my skills in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js, Redux, MongoDB, MySQL, AWS, Git, Bootstrap, HTML5, and CSS3. My expertise in these technologies has enabled me to increase revenue and scale by 32% by automating content ordering, payment capturing, and invoicing flow for Pepper Content Global Pvt. Ltd., where I currently serve as a Tech Lead.

Throughout my career, I have trained and mentored engineers, conducted bi-weekly architectural meetings to improve software quality, coordinated with operation and QA teams, and encouraged isolation deployment strategy, coding standards, and design systems to ensure the quality of deliverables. 

In my previous roles, I have reduced page loading speed and bundle size of products, created micro-services to cut off operational costs, utilized 3rd party APIs for real-time interactive charts, and integrated standard payment methods. 

I am a problem-solver, critical thinker, and an excellent communicator, with a strong ability to work collaboratively as well as lead a team. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. If you are looking for a Tech Lead who can bring a strong work ethic, technical expertise, and soft skills to your team, let's connect.
