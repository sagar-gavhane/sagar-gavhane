# Hello

My name is Sagar Gavhane.

Passionate software engineer with 5+ years of experience in building products for numerous domains like fin-tech, real estate, video streaming, retail, and now e-commerce.

I'm currently available for work, you can take a look at [my resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1muStmZRnSzxEgleP6LY6YglgK3VO1tCY3Irxr7cLlZk/view?usp=sharing).

I have an old blog which I no longer actively update - you probably want to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sagar_codes), [Medium](https://medium.com/@sagar_gavhane), and [Dev](https://dev.to/sagar) for more up-to-date content.

Most of my work is open source and publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sagar-gavhane).

I spend my time Tweeting, taking photographs, making art, and writing code. I also write about best practices, emerging technologies, and lack thereof.

Thank You
